### 5 of the most important equations in quantum mechanics:
**SchrÃ¶dinger Equation** (time-dependent):
$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$$
*This equation describes how the quantum state of a system evolves over time. It relates the rate of change of the wavefunction $\Psi$ to the Hamiltonian operator $\hat{H}$, which represents the total energy of the system.*

**SchrÃ¶dinger Equation** (time-independent):
$$\hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r}) = E\Psi(\mathbf{r})$$
*This is the time-independent form of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, used to find the stationary states and energy levels of a system.*

**Born Rule** (probability interpretation):
$$\int_{V}|\Psi(\mathbf{r})|^2 dV = 1$$
*This equation states that the square of the wavefunction $|\Psi|^2$ represents the probability density of finding a particle at a given position.

**Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**:
$$\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$
*This principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties (such as position and momentum) can be simultaneously measured.*

**Dirac Equation** (relativistic):
$$\left(i\hbar\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu - mc\right)\Psi = 0$$
*This is the relativistic wave equation for spin-1/2 particles, proposed by Paul Dirac, which incorporates both quantum mechanics and special relativity.
